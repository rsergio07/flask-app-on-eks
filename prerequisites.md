## Before diving in, let's ensure you have the necessary tools:

# AWS Account

You'll need an AWS account with permissions to create and manage resources like EKS clusters, EC2 instances, IAM roles, and S3 buckets.

# Infrastructure Tools

-  Terraform: This tool helps manage and provision infrastructure as code. Download and install Terraform based on your operating system from the official website: https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install
-  AWS CLI: Interact with AWS services from your command line. Install the AWS CLI using pip (Python package manager) or download the package from the AWS website: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html

# Containerization Tools

-  Docker (Recommended): Build Docker images of your Flask application. Download and install Docker Desktop from the official website: https://www.docker.com/
-  Podman (Optional): If you prefer a container engine alternative, install Podman, a daemonless option compatible with Docker. You can install Podman via package managers or follow instructions on the Podman GitHub repository.

# Kubernetes Management

Kubectl: This command-line tool lets you interact with your Kubernetes clusters. Install kubectl using a package manager or download the binary from the Kubernetes website: https://kubernetes.io/releases/download/

# Version Control and CI/CD

GitHub Account: Set up a GitHub account to leverage GitHub Actions for your deployment pipeline. Sign up for a free account if you don't have one: https://github.com/Index

# AWS Access

IAM Credentials: Configure AWS IAM credentials with sufficient permissions for Terraform to provision resources and the AWS CLI to interact with AWS services. Refer to the AWS documentation for guidance: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-authentication-user.html
